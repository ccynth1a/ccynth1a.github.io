        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm CCynth1a, a Transgender Computer Science student and hobbyist programmer from the UK and huge deer enthusiast. I'm most interested in 'Low-Level' systems development, particularly in C and Rust, but I do branch out into other areas for fun! I am also, as you can most definitely tell, not a web developer! If you want to contact me, please use the links to the right :)</p>
